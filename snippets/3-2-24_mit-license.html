            <p>
                If you’ve been involved in open-source development, you’ve likely seen code or documentation files marked with the “MIT License.” For a good amount of time, I didn't quite know what this meant or what the purpose was. <i>Why was my university licensing nearly all the open-source code I ever looked at??? </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The MIT License was first developed at MIT (crazy! you would have never guessed it!) in the late 1980s as open source code was becoming more prevalent. The purpose of the MIT License is to grant permission to users to reuse code for any purpose, even if the code is originally part of proprietary software—that is, as long as users include the original copy of the MIT license in their distribution. The MIT License also allows for commercial use. With it, however, the software and license owner cannot be charged for damages. To use the MIT license, all developers need to do is copy the license text and include it in source files. 
            </p>
            <p>
                According to <a href="https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-mit-license/">this</a> source, in 2019 researchers found
                that 27% of all open-source licenses on Github were using the MIT License, making it the most popular
                open source license that exists. There are many other licenses, most of which can be categorized in two
                groups: <i>copyleft</i> or <i>permissive</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
                In a <b>copyleft</b> license, code derived from the original open source code inherits its license
                terms. The most popular copyleft open source licenses include GPL, AGPL, EPL, and Mozilla, as described
                below and in more detail in <a href="https://snyk.io/learn/open-source-licenses/">this article</a> by
                Synk.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you use <b>GNU General Public License (GPL)</b> code in your software (e.g. by using a GPL library),
                        and distribute your application, all your source code must be made available under the same GPL
                        license. A loophole exists, however, for software that is made available over the network only
                        (i.e. not explicitly “distributed”).</li>
                    <li><b>Affero GPL (AGPL)</b> closes the loophole in GPL by also including a remote interaction clause that triggers the GPL license for any software used over a network.</li>
                    <li><b>Eclipse Public License (EPL)</b> enables software developed using EPL, non-EPL, and proprietary code to be combined and sub-licensed as long as non-EPL elements reside independently as separate modules. </li>
                    <li>The <b>Mozilla Public License (MPL)</b> makes it easy to modify and use MPL-licensed code in closed-source and/or proprietary software, as long as any code licensed under the MPL is kept in separate files and these files are distributed with the software.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, a <b>permissive</b> license is more lax and provides more freedom for reuse, modification, and distribution. Unlike for the copyleft license, software with a permissive license does not have to disclose its source, have the same license as its sources, or typically state changes. The most popular permissive licenses are Apache, MIT, BSD, and Unilicense.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>Apache License</b> enables derivative works, larger projects, or modifications to carry different licensing terms when distributed. It also contains a patent grant.</li>
                    <li>The <b>MIT License</b>, as I’ve described above, allows anyone to do whatever they wish with the original code, as long as the original copyright and license notice is included.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) License</b> allows larger or licensed works to be distributed without source code and under different license terms</li>
                    <li>The <b>Unlicense</b> is equivalent to making open source open to public domain. There are no conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Evidently, there are a lot of different licenses out there and it’s likely more will get created to handle the use of AI in writing code. For now, however, using the MIT License seems to be a safe bet!</p>
