            <div class="project-description">
                <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg machine</a> is a contraption intentionally designed to perform a simple task in an overly complicated (but significantly cooler) way. It involves a chain reaction where the completition of one “action” leads to the initiation of the next “action.” Typically, these machines are giant in size--like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w">this one</a>, for example--but my goal was to create one as <i>small as possible</i>, combining as many unique forms of energy transfer (i.e. mechanical, electrical, and chemical) within a space less than one cubic foot in size.</p>

                <p>Listed below are the steps in the design of my device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Step 1</b>: A ping-pong ball is dropped into a plastic container, causing a thin, aluminum lever to lift. A golf ball previously pressed down by the lever is then able to roll underneath the lever, down a slight incline, hitting a metal ball that then gets pushed forwards.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 2</b>: The metal ball rolls forward and to the right, dropping into a small, plastic bucket.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 3</b>: The metal ball's fall pushes up a series of three levers (first class, third class, second class). The final lever then pushes a microswitch, activating a relay.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 4</b>: The relay completes a circuit, causing current flow in a nicrhome wire. The resulting heat melts a fishing line threaded through the wire.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 5</b>: The fishing line is secured tightly on a spool on a corner of the device and is connected to one end of a spring below the top of a 15 centimeter inclined plane. The other end of the spring is attached to a 500 gram mass, located at the bottom end of the inclined plane. When the fishing line breaks (step 4), the spring's tension is released, causing the mass to move up the plane.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 6</b>: Upon reaching the top of the inclined plane, the mass hits a lever, causing a metal rod to push down on the side of a large, metal ball, which then rolls down the slight ramp it is on.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 7</b>: The metal ball drops into a cup connected to a pulley system of IMA 3, causing a 500 gram mass on the other end of the pulley to rise 15 centimeters.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 8</b>: A rod attached to the rising mass pushes a metal ball placed on a platform through a hole at the bottom of the platform, causing the ball to fall off.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 9</b>: There is a string attached to the falling ball (step 8) that is wrapped around a screw so that as the ball falls, the screw turns. The turning of the screw causes it to move backwards and with it, pull a hook holding open a platform connected to a mousetrap's hammer.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 10</b>: As the hook gets pulled off from the platform, the platform jerks forward, launching a quarter placed on top, so that it flips from heads to tails and lands on a lever.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 11</b>: The weight of the quarter pushes the lever down onto a microswitch, sending current to a Peltier cooler to produce a temperature difference.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 12</b>: After a sensor detects a sufficient temperature difference, it activates a relay which causes a servo motor to turn to open the valve of a water pump.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 13</b>: Water flows from the pump into a glass jar through a rubber tube, causing a golf ball atop a piece of foam in the jar to rise up. Upon reachign the top of the jar, a wedge causes the gold ball to roll out onto a lever.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 14</b>: The pressure of the golf ball on a lever pushes down a microswitch, causing a servo motor to turn 180 degrees. A magnet connected to the servo motor and holding up a miniature plastic cup inside a glass container then gets pulled away.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 15</b>: Consequently, the plastic cup inside the container falls to the bottom of the container. Baking soda within the cup comes into contact with vinegar, producing gas that then inflates a balloon tied around the top of the container.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 16</b>: The balloon inflates vertically 20 centimeters and pushes a plastic sheet up so that it breaks an IR beam, activating a relay.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 17</b>: Once the relay has been activated, a motor begins turning, winding a string around itself so that a platform on rails is then pulled up. The platform rises for 20 centimeters, above the rest of the machine, signalling that it has successfully completed.</li>
                </ul>
